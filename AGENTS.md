The first project is to set up a few tools:
- node creation names the wert and creates a file, placing it in the master folder
- wert-acquisition names a file in the master folder and places it as a link to a node at the heading level.
- wert-occupancy/valence-setting feeds a value node into a function which pre-processes it, then there are options for its activation state, after filling out the options the data is embedded at that node level.

The structure of these files should be configs for an emacs setup. In the readme add a section on installation which explains how to set up a temporary emacs directory, a master file, and then the command to run which loads the emacs via the configs. make sure the color scheme is dark, but just use custom and put it at the top of the init. Ultimately, the init should load custom and a folder containing the config files. Then we will just work on the config files while also open-mindedly discussing the values in master as we develop and test them.
